# Victorious Duel (opponent slain or spared)

# Called for 1) battlefield duels, 2) feast duels, 3) rival duels, 4) regency duels, etc. (check various_duel_events.txt)
# FROM = loser, ROOT = winner.  Ergo, if we want to reference the loser of the duel in a notification event fired from here,
# FROMFROM will be the loser and ROOT=FROM will be the winner. This event is a model of duel_output.1 scope-wise, and indeed,
# it was originally called directly from NDE's duel outcomes rather than duel_output. However, I wanted to minimize merge
# conflicts with NDE, so duel_output.1 forwards back to the [possibly dead] loser in cta.11, which immediately bounces
# back to the winner here, in cta.10, allowing full access to FROMFROM (and FROMFROM's portait) in child events. A little
# silly but not.
#
# Again, this is a hidden-window event which does bookkeeping and only fires visible messaging events when appropriate.
# It could not be (unlike the combat impulse event), but a single victorious duel does not earn an experience tier (only 3
# and always exactly 3 victories would be required if it did).  Instead, each duel win has a random chance of advancing
# the character's experience tier.  The cumulative density function for experience tier advancement needs to be tuned for
# balance.
#
# NOTE: progress notifications were skipped in this case, as there is enough event-chain clutter for the user to click
#       their way through during/after duels (and they're likely in the middle of a battle, which presents yet more).
#
